The danparcorpR package, abbreviation for (The Danish Parliament Corpus in R) is package provides the *clean* and *tidy* data for each year of Parlimant running from October to the following June. For each working year, (2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,205,2016) the package provides the table containing the following columns:

* MeetingId  - the total hourly demand and supply (generation) for electricity in the US since July 2015

* MÃ¸denummer  - the US net generation of electricity by energy source (natural gas, coal, solar, etc.) since July 2018

* Sagstype   - The California subregion hourly demand by operator since July 2018

* Starttid

* Sluttid

* Navn

* Parti

* Rolle

* Tekst

All datasets are in [tsibble](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/index.html) format

## Examples

The hourly demand and generation (supply) of electricty in the US:

``` r
library(USgrid)
library(plotly)

data(US_elec)

plot_ly(data = US_elec,
        x = ~ date_time,
        y = ~ series,
        color = ~ type,
        colors = c("#66C2A5","#8DA0CB"),
        type = "scatter",
        mode = "lines") %>%
        layout(title = "US Electricity Demand vs. Supply (Hourly)",
               yaxis = list(title = "Mwh"),
               xaxis = list(title = "Source: US Energy Information Administration (Dec 2019)"))
```

The hourly generation (supply) of electricty in the US by source:
``` r
plot_ly(data = US_source,
        x = ~ date_time,
        y = ~ series,
        color = ~ source,
        type = "scatter",
        mode = "lines") %>%
  layout(title = "US Electricity Generation by Energy Source",
         yaxis = list(title = "Mwh"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: US Energy Information Administration (Dec 2019)"))
```

The California subregion hourly demand by operator

``` r
plot_ly(data = Cal_elec,
        x = ~ date_time,
        y = ~ series,
        color = ~ operator,
        type = "scatter",
        mode = "lines") %>%
  layout(title = "California Hourly Demand by Operator",
         yaxis = list(title = "Mwh"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Source: US Energy Information Administration (Dec 2019)"))
```
